    abstract = {We present an efficient ray-tracing technique to render bokeh
      effects produced by parametric aspheric lenses. Contrary to conventional
        spherical lenses, aspheric lenses do generally not permit a simple
        closed-form solution of ray-surface intersections. We propose a
        numerical root-finding approach, which uses tight proxy surfaces to
        ensure a good initialization and convergence behavior. Additionally, we
        simulate mechanical imperfections resulting from the lens fabrication
        via a texture-based approach. Fractional Fourier transform and spectral
        dispersion add additional realism to the synthesized bokeh effect. Our
        approach is well-suited for execution on graphics processing units
        (GPUs) and we demonstrate complex defocus-blur and lens-flare effects.},

    abstract="We present a method for faster and more flexible approximation of
      camera defocus effects given a focused image of a virtual scene and depth
      map. Our method leverages the advantages of low-rank linear filtering by
      reducing the problem of 2D convolution to multiple 1D convolutions, which
      significantly reduces the computational complexity of the filtering
      operation. In the case of rank 1 filters (e.g., the box filter and
          Gaussian filter), the kernel is described as `separable' since it can
      be implemented as a horizontal 1D convolution followed by a 1D vertical
      convolution. While many filter kernels which result in bokeh effects
      cannot be approximated closely by separable kernels, they can be
      effectively approximated by low-rank kernels. We demonstrate the speed and
      flexibility of low-rank filters by applying them to image blurring,
    tilt-shift postprocessing, and depth-of-field simulation, and also analyze
      the approximation error for several aperture shapes.",

    abstract="Bokeh effect is an important characteristic for realistic image
      synthesis. However, existing bokeh rendering methods are incapable of
      simulating realistic bokeh effects due to not taking into account optical
      characteristics of real lenses, especially optical aberrations. In this
      paper, a novel realistic bokeh rendering method, based on an accurate
      camera lens model and distributed ray tracing, is presented. An optical
      analysis of the relationship between bokeh and optical aberrations,
    including spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism and field curvature, is
      firstly introduced. Based on this analysis, a physically-based camera lens
      model, which takes detailed lens prescription as input, is then introduced
      for accurately modeling the aberrations. The position and diameter of the
        entrance and exit pupils are calculated by tracing rays inside the lens
          for achieving efficient ray sampling, and a general sequential ray
            tracing algorithm is proposed to better combine with bidirectional
              ray tracing. Furthermore, correct integration between the lens
              model and bidirectional ray tracing is also analyzed. The
              rendering results demonstrate a variety of realistic bokeh effects
              caused by the aberrations.",

      two key techniques: an accurate dispersive lens model and an efficient
      spectral rendering scheme. This lens model is implemented based on optical
      data of real lenses and considers wavelength dependency of physical lenses
      by introducing a sequential dispersive ray tracing algorithm inside this
      model. This spectral rendering scheme is proposed to support rendering of
      lens dispersion and integration between this new model and bidirectional
      ray tracing. The rendering experiments demonstrate that our method is able
